## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Daniel and I like to code. My interests vary widely, from optimization to security. 

Stuff I'm working on:
- Subgrubs 'n' Snazzards' official [server bot](https://github.com/dtangres/Subgrubs-n-Snazzards-Bot).
- Assorted bits and bobs [here](https://github.com/dtangres/portfolio).

I'm looking for a place to work on something cool with like-minded devs.
